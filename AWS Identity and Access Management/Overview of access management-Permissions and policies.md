# Overview of access management: Permissions and policies
The access management portion of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps you define what a principal entity is allowed to do in an account. A principal entity is a person or application that is authenticated using an IAM entity (user or role). Access management is often referred to as authorization. You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal uses an IAM entity (user or role) to make a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents.

### **Policies and accounts**
If you manage a single account in AWS, then you define the permissions within that account using policies. If you manage permissions across multiple accounts, it is more difficult to manage permissions for your users. You can use IAM roles, resource-based policies, or access control lists (ACLs) for cross-account permissions. However, if you own multiple accounts, its recommend using the AWS Organizations service to help you manage those permissions.
